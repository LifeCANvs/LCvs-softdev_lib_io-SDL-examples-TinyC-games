# Features

* Cross-platform: Win, Mac, Linux, ...
* No configuration or setup
* Just click to compile and run
* As little as 200 LOC for each game
* Built on SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
* Runs with TCC (the Tiny C Compiler)
* REAL ACTUAL GAMES

# What's wrong?!

Getting into cross-platform C game programming is too hard. One misstep and you could get lost in hours/days/weeks of setup and configuration before ever getting something to run. Let's skip all that and make something anyone can run right now out-of-the-box.

# The goal

The goal of tinyc.games is to have something for those interested in C game programming (the GOOD way to make games!) where:

* You can click a thing to run real code in less than a minute after downloading it.
* You can look at the code and understand it sometime soon (~200 lines of simple code for a simple game).
* You can make changes to a game's code see your changes in the running game right quick.
* NO additional configuration, Googling for downloads, or installing required.

# How close are we to the goal?

* On Windows everything you need is included in tinyc.games.
* On Mac you'll need to install clang (it's easy!).
* On most Linuxes you'll need to install tcc & SDL2, available from your system's package manager.

See the tiny README for specific information.

Further testing on more machines always helps!
